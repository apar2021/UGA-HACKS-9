# UGA Hacks 9 Project
Team Members: Cole Sottile, Joshua Yawn, Aparna Sajith, Jovita Chang

This was our project that involved a machine learning model fed with two datasets both concentrated on spam and phishing emails. 
Using our ML model, we were able to identify phishing email based on email content. 

Technologies: Flask, Javascript, Python, sklearn, nltk, HTML, CSS

Problems: We utilized Cloudflare to create LLM apps. However, we were unable to merge or look into the applications of AI using the application 
due to unclear documentation and very little information.
